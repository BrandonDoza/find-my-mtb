      <h2>Why Should I Get Into Mountain Biking?</h2>
      <p>
        Mountain biking is a great sport for those looking to increase their
        fitness level, get out into nature, meet new people, and challenge their
        physical abilities.
      </p>
      <h2>Which Bike Is Right For Me?</h2>
      <p>
        When choosing a bike, you need to consider a few things. Where will you
        ride it most of the time? What type of riding do you like best? What is
        your skill level on a bike? What is your budget? Answering these few
        questions will get you pointed in the right direction. At the end of the
        day, your bike is all about you!
      </p>
      <h2>Is Mountain Biking Hard?</h2>
      <p>
        Mountain biking can be hard, but don't be intimidated. Trails range from
        beginner to expert (kind of just like a ski mountain). The learning
        curve is steep to become an expert rider, but that doesn't mean you
        can't have a ton of fun on the journey to get there. The most important
        thing to remember is to take it slow at first. Don't try to overdo it
        with rides that are too long, or ride trails that are above your skill
        level. It's best to find a partner that is at your level to ride with,
        or someone that is a bit more advanced than you, who's willing to hang
        back and give you some pointers. Stopping into your local bike shop can
        be helpful too. They can guide you on gear, and maybe even know of some
        group rides or clinics that can help to get you going.
      </p>
      <h2>Now What?</h2>
      <p>
        Now get out there and start to challenge yourself. Whether it's just to
        get outside, hang with friends, make it down that steep trail, or pop
        off that jump you've been eyeing, mountain biking is extremely
        rewarding.
