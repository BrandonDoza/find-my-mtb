# Find My Mtb

## Project Overview: 
This application is designed to assist individuals in their search for a new mountain bike, catering to both newcomers and seasoned mountain biking enthusiasts. By offering tailored recommendations based on user preferences, the app simplifies the process of finding the perfect bike for various skill levels and riding terrains.

## Features:
- Personalized Bike Search: Users can search for bikes tailored to their ability level and the type of terrain they plan to ride. This ensures that recommendations are suited to their specific needs and preferences.
- Detailed Bike Information: Upon searching, users can view a list of recommended bikes. By clicking on an individual bike, they can access comprehensive details and specifications.
- Favorite Bikes: Users have the ability to favorite bikes, allowing them to easily save and view these selections later in the "My Bikes" section.
- Browse All Bikes: In addition to personalized searches, users can explore the entire database of bikes. This feature allows users to browse all available options and perform actions such as viewing detailed information and favoriting bikes.

### Installation: 
- git clone `https://github.com/BrandonDoza/find-my-mtb.git` - for https
- git clone `git@github.com:BrandonDoza/find-my-mtb.git` - for ssh
- cd find-my-mtb
- npm install
- npm start
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  
#### Testing: 
Testing is done with the Cypress end to end library to ensure proper UI/UX performance, navigation, and flow. 
#### To run testing:
- npm run cypress
- Choose E2E testing
- Choose the browser you would like to run the test in
- Choose the test you would like to begin with in Cypress/e2e folder:
- allBikeErrorHandling.cy.js
- singleBikeErrorHandling.cy.js
- spec.cy.js
- *** NOTE: In Cypress, you will see a non intercepted xhr request ((xhr)GET https://unpkg.com/boxicons@2.1.4/svg/regular/bx-send.svg). This is from the boxicons library that was installed for the icons throughout the application. There is no way to stub and intecept these in cypress. They do not affect the e2e testing for this application.

### API
